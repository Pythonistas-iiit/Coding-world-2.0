Question 1 :
You are given a word W as a query. Your answer word A is acceptable if it is the same length as 
the query, and the i-th letter of A is either the i-th, (i-1)th, or (i+1)th letter of W, for all i in 
the range of the length of A. (The first letter of A must match either the first or second letter 
of W, since the 0th letter of W doesn't exist. Similarly, the last letter of A must match either 
the last or next-to-last letter of W.) Note that the target word itself is always an acceptable 
answer word.Find out how many distinct acceptable answer words there are.

Please mention the time and space complexity of your code.
